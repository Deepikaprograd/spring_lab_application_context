<h3>What are drone light shows?</h3>

<p>
Drone Light Shows are a combination of drones programmed to fly in 3D space to make 
identifiable visual forms. To do this an animation is prepared based on the requirements 
of the client. Drone light shows are also an eco-friendly alternative to fireworks. 
Apart from that drone light shows can also be used to deliver messages to a large audience.
